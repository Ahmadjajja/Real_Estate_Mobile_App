Introducing the Real Estate Mobile App - a fantastic final hackathon project created by me in just 12 hours of time! This impressive app was developed using cutting-edge technologies such as React-Native, Node JS, MongoDB, Express JS, and Native Base.

The Real Estate Mobile App comes loaded with amazing features, including authentication, a dashboard, a landing page, view and add property functionality, as well as delete and update property options. Additionally, the app has a call-to-action feature that allows users to contact property owners for purchases, a search feature to help users find specific properties, and even a like/dislike feature to make property browsing even more interactive and fun!

The backend of the app is equally impressive, with authentication, REST APIs for adding, deleting, updating, and creating properties, and REST APIs for tracking likes and dislikes.

Overall, the Real Estate Mobile App is an incredible project that showcases the my skill and creativity in using the latest technologies to build a top-notch mobile app that is sure to impress anyone in the real estate industry.
